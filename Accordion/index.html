                My plans include learning other programming languages like
                python, java, typescript. I want to fine-tune my craft and
                problem solving skills.

              <p>
                With my frontend skills, I'm sure I'll be able to land a job.
                Issue is to do that, I have to be very good at what I do since
                AI is threatening people.

                I just have to keep practicing and also be eager to learn. And
                also I should know so many technologies. That way I can keep up
                with the current trends and make myself invaluable.

                Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. I guess it all depends on
                what side of the bed i wake up on that particular day. Either
                ways I'm grateful for the mentor I have and the people
                supporting me.
